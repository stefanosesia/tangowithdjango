This website was built using only html, no scripts or CSS, it was built as part of the Web App Development 2 course.</br>
The website responds to the given requirements and is NOT dynamic.</br>
Given the fact that for each edit, we need to modify every file that depends on the data modified, the complexity is then exponential to the pages in which the said data is referenced.</br>
To add a new category for example, we need to modify or add the new link on each other category single page and in the home, to change the banner or the footer we need to modify each page.</br>
Scaling factors and rearrangement for different screen sizes are not fully taken into consideration, the website is not mobile friendly.</br>
The website present loads of redundancy, and same portions of code are continuously repeated in various pages</br>
The data is static and arbitrarily chosen. </br>
</br>
A solution to the problem could be using CSS for a more dynamic, scalable and readable solution.</br>
Integrating some back-end scripts able to retrive dinamicly changable data, making it easy to modify and mantain the website.</br>
Code the common part and templates once and just importing them, this way the layout and content its easily editable and upgradable</br>
